                <p> Hello! My name is Silvia Trejo. After completing a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I decided to go back to school at Kennesaw State to pursue a BS in Cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <p> My professional experience in education has taught me many vital skills such as mediation, critical thinking, and problem solving. I have worked in an array of positions throughout my career teaching me adaptability and coachability. Through my experiences I am looking forward to transitioning into a new position in IT that challenges me and where I can incorporate my past experiences while developing new skillsets.
                </p>
                <p> I am an avid reader and a lifelong learner. I love hiking and photography which makes Georgia a great place to live.
